### Simple Interest

The Interest that is charged on the Principal amount every year is called Simple Interest.

The Formula to calculate Simple Interest is:

SI = (P x T x R) / 100

Here:
- \( P \) is the Principal amount,
- \( T \) is the time (No. of years),
- \( R \) is the Rate of Interest (in %).

### Compound Interest

The Interest that is charged on the Principal amount as well as on the Previous Interest is called Compound Interest.

The Formula to calculate Compound Interest is:

CI = A - P

Here:
- \( A \) is the Amount,
- \( P \) is the Principal.

To calculate the Amount, the formula is:

A = P x [1 + R/100] ^ T

Where:
- \( P \) is the Principal amount,
- \( R \) is the Rate of Interest (in %),
- \( T \) is the time (No. of years).
